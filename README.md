# CareerInformationTracker-PowerSchool
My second plugin created for PowerSchool (SIS)

This plugin has been created after hearing requests from our Career Transitions Teachers that they would like a way to track student information and data related to post-secondary applications, scholarships, completed certificates, and volunteer experience. As this information is all related to long term career planning, I have decided to package the content as a single plugin.  

Currently the plugin can be viewed as a "digital notepad" as once content is entered it is directly editable to allow for fluid data updates during student meetings.

Note: I utilized KB74828 heavily as this is my first attempt at building a fully functional plugin."Database Extensions Advanced User Guide for PowerSchool 9.x" contains a similar idea for tracking both applications and scholarships. I would like to acknowledge the writers of this document at this time as they have provided great insight and many examples which have influenced this plugin. Thanks very much! 

-- Special Note --
1. The Band Support section of this plugin can be hidden if not applicable to your school or division by changing the preference setting at:
